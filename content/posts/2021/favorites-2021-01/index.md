## Stuff & Things

- [Signal](https://www.signal.org/) ‚Äì I use the messenger a while already. Recommended by Edward Snowden, end-to-end encrypted, no ads, no tracking, open-source. Drop _WhatsApp_ and join!
- [Minds](https://www.minds.com/) ‚Äì I rediscovered this blockchain-based social network that is a mix of Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. I had tried it in 2018 but stopped using it. In the meantime, it improved massively and the plans for 2021 look fantastic: Including the Matrix decentralized communication network, group chats, file sharing, e2e encryption, and much more. I started sharing things in I like in [my stream](https://www.minds.com/kogakure/) and had a much better exposure than on Twitter.
- [Session](https://getsession.org/) ‚Äì A nice new end-to-end open-source encrypted messenger based on the [Loki network](https://loki.network/) that uses no phone numbers, but instead a Session id, and is resistant to censorship or data breaches. It supported Group Chats, voice messages, attachments, and disappearing messages. All messages are routed through an onion routing network. My Session id is `05f4473f1b7b4ea42c3471453c42665142aa295d3c3d9d31b8e8d05780237ff540`.
- [The StoryGraph](https://www.thestorygraph.com/) ‚Äì A nice app to track your reading and choose the next book based on your mood and favorite topics and themes. It allows importing your Goodreads library. You can follow me [here](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/27a1bb49-a1e0-4eed-9465-457c42b51161).
- [Thinkspot](https://www.thinkspot.com) ‚Äì I stumbled on _Jordan Petersons_ anti-censorship social network service, he created in 2019. It‚Äôs still in beta but hosts interesting intellectual people and content.
- [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) ‚Äì The Inter-Planetary File System is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol. I learned about it because [Brave integrated it this month into its browser](https://brave.com/brave-integrates-ipfs/). It‚Äôs a file-based decentralized internet that is fast and not possible to censor because you request files, not location addresses. It was used to make Wikipedia accessible again in Turkey after the government blocked access to the site. [DTube](https://d.tube/) is a video website, running on IPFS. I read through the documentation, watched [this](https://youtu.be/5Uj6uR3fp-U) and [this](https://youtu.be/N4RKKHSyZlk) video and plan on reading [The IPFS Primer](https://flyingzumwalt.gitbooks.io/decentralized-web-primer/).
- [This is Tulsi Gabbard](https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/this-is-tulsi-gabbard/id1549623127) ‚Äì The new podcast of Tulsi Gabbard coming soon.
- [Facts Matter with Roman Balmakov](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXuwhn5_41m4VxZJ3wcDyxA/) ‚Äì If you‚Äôre interested in US politics and want mostly unbiased and un-opinionated news coverage, this new channel by _The Epoch Times_ summarizes what happened 2-3 times a week.

## Quotes

<Blockquote author="Karl Popper" source="The Open Society and Its Enemies">

Less well known is the paradox of tolerance: Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.‚ÄîIn this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant.

<Blockquote author="Thomas Sowell" source="Intellectuals and Race, Pos. 988">

In Asia, as in Europe, Africa, and the Western Hemisphere, the intelligentsia have been prominent among those pushing ethnic identity ideology and intergroup polarization. Under such influences, Sri Lanka went from being a country whose record for harmonious relations between majority and minority was held up to the world as a model by many observers, in the mid-twentieth century, to a country whose later ethnic polarization produced decades of mob violence and then outright civil war, in which unspeakable atrocities were committed, on into the early twenty-first century.

<Blockquote author="Thomas Sowell" source="Intellectuals and Race, Pos. 1818">

Nothing is easier than to find some individuals ‚Äî in any group‚Äî who share a given writer‚Äôs opinion, and to quote such individuals as if their views were typical. This approach became common in media coverage of ghetto riots. Newsweek magazine, for example, quoted various black youths, including one described as ‚Äúa child of Detroit‚Äôs ravaged ghetto,‚Äù even though the poverty rate among Detroit‚Äôs black population before the riots was only half of that of blacks nationwide, the homeownership rate among blacks in Detroit was the highest in the nation, and the unemployment rate of blacks in Detroit was 3.4 percent‚Äî lower than that among whites nationwide. It was after the riots that Detroit became a ravaged community, and remained so for decades thereafter, as businesses withdrew, taking jobs and taxes with them. But here, as elsewhere, an idea that fit the vision did not have to meet the additional requirement of fitting the facts.

<Blockquote author="Thomas Sowell" source="Intellectuals and Race, Pos. 2144">

If criminals, rioters, and vandals from within the group are to be automatically defended or excused for the sake of group solidarity, then the costs of that solidarity include not only a lower standard of living, since such people raise the costs of doing business in their neighborhoods and thereby raise the prices of goods and services above what they are in other neighborhoods, such people also cause fewer businesses to locate in their neighborhoods and fewer taxis to be willing to take people to such neighborhoods. Worst of all, the damage committed by those representing the lowest common denominator‚Äî encompassing crimes up to and including murder‚Äî is overwhelmingly against other members of their own group.

<Blockquote author="Thomas Sowell">

The first lesson of economics is scarcity: there is never enough of anything to fully satisfy all those who want it.

The first lesson of politics is to disregard the first lesson of economics.

Some things are believed because they are demonstrably true, but many other things are believed simply because they have been asserted repeatedly.

<Blockquote author="Paul Joseph Watson" source="AMERICA 2021, 6:06" sourceUrl="https://youtu.be/p1kUN0MyMHw">

Four years of bombing kids in the middle east while hollowing out America‚Äôs economy for the benefits of weapons contractors, Wall Street, and predatory transnational corporations. All hail the resistance. Just a hunch, but if your political consensus is shared and amplified by every major cultural institution, establishment media empire, and billionaire tech oligarch in the world, maybe, just maybe, call me crazy but, maybe you‚Äôre not the resistance?

<Blockquote author="Aldous Huxley">

The propagandist‚Äôs purpose is to make one set of people forget that certain other sets of people are human.
