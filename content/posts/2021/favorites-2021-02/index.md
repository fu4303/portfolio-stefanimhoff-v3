## Podcasts

### Dan Carlin‚Äôs Hardcore History

I started listening to this podcast because it was repeatedly recommended on _The Joe Rogan Experience_, _Elon Musk_ and other people. This month I listened to nearly 14 hours on the history of the Persian Empire and its clash with Greek civilization. Incredibly good! _Dan Carlin_ produces 2-3 podcasts per year.

## People

### Tom MacDonald

I discovered this brilliant Rapper because his new song [Fake Woke](https://youtu.be/2l6JUNFAJ9o) landed on the top of the US charts. He is an independent artist and his girlfriend creates his awesome music videos.

He went viral in 2017 after criticizing the Rap culture with his song [Dear Rappers](https://youtu.be/aGip64cYJTg). In 2020 he wrote [Blame The Rappers](https://youtu.be/30CDHuiRCrc) that addresses the toxic influence of Rap culture on children.

In songs as [Whiteboy](https://youtu.be/oxJtX081jj4), [No Lives Matter](https://youtu.be/t86ClLM3ZGY), [People So Stupid](https://youtu.be/I6FmwBPDT-w), or [Buttholes](https://youtu.be/83Ntpeih4f4) he criticizes social issues in the US for example racism, identity politics, or cancel culture.

In [Best Rapper Ever](https://youtu.be/9y4IAdZ8srA) he deals with his shadow, anxiety, alcoholism, and self-doubt. His beautiful song [Angels](https://youtu.be/dFlspSoW430) deals with addiction and suicide.

He has a strong connection to his fans and haters. [My Fans](https://youtu.be/LnlJQ7nJp_E) is a heart-warming homage to his fans. His song [I Wish](https://youtu.be/8wNUjCcaGrM) used [send-in video wishes](https://youtu.be/8WdTn0vly54).

Due to his honest rap songs, he has to deal with a lot of online hate. He mocks these attacks in his funny songs [Everybody Hates Me](https://youtu.be/Vny0W0axomc) or [Fake Fans](https://youtu.be/gT5DpOiQ_WA).

After the rapper _Mac Lethal_ insulted _Tom MacDonald_ on Twitter (Tweet now deleted), Tom responded just two days later with a brilliant diss in [Lethal Injection](https://youtu.be/FdXGEKHitwg). Mac Lethal answered with a rap in [Single White Female](https://youtu.be/xCEkwCJp5ns) and was burned with another professional produced rap diss and music video _one day later_ in [Mac Lethal Sucks](https://youtu.be/n2-KlNwcTdk) that has 10 million views. That burn definitely hurt. üòÇ It‚Äôs clear who won. The self-ironic diss [Im Corny](https://youtu.be/3p6ibNunyN8) on himself is funnier and better than any hater could ever write.

### John D. Boswell (aka Melodysheep)

I discovered the fantastic videos of [Melodysheep](https://www.melodysheep.com/) in 2019 but wasn‚Äôt aware till this month that it‚Äôs only one person and not a company.

John D. Boswell is a filmmaker, composer, VFX artist, and editor from the pacific northwest.

His skill is incredible, he produced content for National Geographic, Disney, PBS, and many others.

The first video I saw of him was [Timelapse of the Future: A Journey to the End of Time](https://youtu.be/uD4izuDMUQA) which travels from today into the far future to the end of the universe. The video was watched by over 50 million people and is a [musical](https://music.apple.com/artist/melodysheep/555989104) and visual experience in 4K that lasts 30 minutes. Other highly recommended movies are [Timelapse of the Entire Universe](https://youtu.be/TBikbn5XJhg), [Life beyond: Chapter 1. Alien life, deep time, and our place in cosmic history](https://youtu.be/SUelbSa-OkA), [Life Beyond II: The Museum of Alien Life](https://youtu.be/ThDYazipjSI), and [The Secret History of the Moon](https://youtu.be/The Secret History of the Moon).

## Quotes

<Blockquote author="Tom van der Linden" source="Redefining the Anti-War Film" sourceUrl="https://youtu.be/yf0G2MPBEYM">

After the second world war, for example, there were many who believed that by achieving victory over the Nazis we also achieved victory over the Evil they represented, which unfortunately isn‚Äôt the case. But it goes to show that there is a fine line between recognizing a real threat to one‚Äôs self or community and using that threat to delude ourselves into believing that we can erase the shadow of our own light by violently putting out someone else‚Äôs. It‚Äôs a delusion that often reveals itself through promises like; if only these threats are eliminated, our freedoms will be protected. If only these enemies are destroyed, we will bring honor a justice to our nation. If only we end this war, we will end them all.

The academic Left, at the moment, seems to be routed essentially in semantics games, the redefinition of words in fact.

And the Right, in my experience, and I‚Äôm not saying this exclusive or anything, actually just tends to use the Common English language definitions of words.

And this is why it‚Äôs quite a pleasure to read someone like Thomas Sowell because he never has to redefine a word because he just uses it in the Common English parlance. Because he is not trying to be a pretentious academic about it, he trying to layout: <q>Look, this is the data, this is my interpretation of set data in a common-sense straightforward manner, do you find this persuasive?</q> [‚Ä¶]

Whereas the Left has come up with esoteric ways of looking at things: <q>Well, actually, let me tell you what the real definition of a woman is. Let me tell you what the real definition of a patriarchy is, let me tell you ‚Ä¶</q>

Wait, hang on a second, I didn‚Äôt agree to any of this _real_ re-definitions and I don‚Äôt agree with the final definition you come out with.

The classic example being of course the definition of a woman. For a Right-winger, I guess somebody who isn‚Äôt politicized into the culture war, <q>a woman in the dictionary is an adult human female</q> which is a good and sensible definition. It has particular limits, essential characteristics, and it‚Äôs not self-referential. [‚Ä¶]

Well, the Left's version is: <q>A woman is anyone who identifies as a woman</q> which is actually a very concerning definition. [‚Ä¶] <q>A woman is anyone who identifies as a woman is anyone who identifies as a woman is anyone ‚Ä¶</q> So, you got this reoccurring loop in the definition of the word. So, the sentence is actually never completed. [‚Ä¶]

It gives us no information about what a woman actually is other than some kind of being that identifies as this empty word. [‚Ä¶] The important thing is also what‚Äôs excluded from the word, because if you take out the word adult from the definition of a woman, what you‚Äôre saying is that non-adults, and maybe even non-humans ‚Äì if you take out the human part ‚Äì could identify as women.
