## Things I enjoyed in December 2020

<Blockquote author="Captain America (Mark Millar)" source="Civil War" sourceUrl="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4362177-civil-war">

Wenn the mob and the press and the whole world tell you to move, your job is to plant yourself like a tree beside the river of truth, and tell the whole world <q>No, you move</q>.

## Quotes

<Blockquote author="Jordan B Peterson">

A **harmless man** is _not_ a good man.  
A good man is a very, _very_ **dangerous man**, who has that under **voluntary control**.

</Blockquote>

In _Superman: American Alien_ the young _Clark Kent_ is frustrated and destroys the mirror and wall behind it in a bathroom in a cinema. The next day his father is asking him, what he is thinking about:

<Blockquote author="Clark Kent (Max Landis)" source="Superman: American Alien" sourceUrl="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26152411-superman">

The Mirror. I was thinking ‚Ä¶ somebody had to make it, like somebody at the factory took time to make it. Then somebody had to sell it to the movie theater, and then other people had to fit it to the wall which somebody else built for them. When you break something, you‚Äôre not just breaking the thing, you‚Äôre like hurting every one who made it the way it was.

_Sean W. Malone_ summarizes the quote by _Clark Kent_ (_Max Landis_) above in his video essay _Superman Is the Hero We Need Right Now_ why the stories we tell each other matter and why we need heroes:

<Blockquote author="Sean W. Malone" source="Superman Is the Hero We Need Right Now" sourceUrl="https://youtu.be/daQ7mdRohY0">

That is one of the most insightful realizations anyone could ever have about the world around them, and it was written in a comic book. These stories have survived for decades. They‚Äôve been retold in dozens of languages and they‚Äôre known all over the world. They are _mythology_. And like all mythologies, they‚Äôre about _human values_. They‚Äôre how writers and artists convey their ideas and share lessons about character and morality with everyone else. But not every value anybody puts on screen or in a book is good. The ends don't justify the means. The collective isn‚Äôt more important than the individual. Appealing to the ‚Äúgreater good‚Äù is often just an _excuse_ for the abuse of power. Not every moral lesson anybody takes the time to write down is actually going to make the world a better place. So, the stories we tell each other _matter_. [‚Ä¶] I think we need to start reminding each other that there are some values that are worth standing up for and some that really aren‚Äôt. We need more truth, justice, and respect for **individual freedom**. We need fewer people trying to lie and mislead in order to impose their values on everyone else by force. We need more humility, compassion, and kindness. We need less **anger** and _division_. More calm. Less noise. What I‚Äôm saying is‚Ä¶ We need _actual heroes_.

<Blockquote author="Philip K. Dick">

The basic tool for the manipulation of reality is the manipulation of words. If you can control the meaning of words, you can control the people who must use the words.

We know, of course, that there is no freedom of speech. But few persons realize that there is no freedom of silence, either. Residents of a communist state are required to make positive statements of belief and loyalty.
