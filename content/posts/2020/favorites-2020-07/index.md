## Stuff & Things

- [Ghost of Tsushima](https://www.playstation.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima-ps4/) ‚Äì The new PlayStation exclusive game is Sony‚Äôs fasted-selling game of all times. And rightly so. It is incredibly good! The story is exciting and feels like being in a movie or more accurately in all Samurai movies ever produced at once. It has epic battles, deadly duels, and quiet moments while reflecting with Haiku, praying at a Shinto or Buddhist temple or shrine or while taking a bath in one of the many Onsen. Stunningly beautiful landscapes with falling cherry-blossom or maple tree leaves, endless grasslands, long sandy coastlines, dusty swamplands, or green bamboo forests. Directly next to battlefields with burned corpses, or landscapes and villages burned by the Mongol hordes. You can play with Japanese audio track for the right feeling and even enable Kurosawa mode (black and white with 60s audio) or play with the funny (but useless) photo mode to create videos or photos. The soundtrack was written by _Shigeru Umebayashi_.

- [Testing Playground](https://testing-playground.com/) is a tool to test React Testing Library queries.
- [iA Writer Style Check](https://ia.net/writer/blog/introducing-style-check) ‚Äì My favorite text editor has now style check, a personal assistant that marks redundant words, clich√©s, and filler words as you type.
- [Tabler Icons](https://tablericons.com/) ‚Äì Over 500 free, customizable SVG icons.
- [Element](https://element.io/) ‚Äì The decentralized, open-source chat tool Riot was renamed and landed a [huge deal of 350,000 seats for the German education system](https://sifted.eu/articles/element-germany-deal/). It runs on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@kogakure:matrix.org).

## Quotes

This month was _very_ political. We can see the Progressive Left and political correctness reaching the tolerable limit. There was the open letter, signed by 150 political-left people of influence, for example, _Steven Pinker_, _Malcolm Gladwell_, _Jonathan Haidt_, _Bari Weiss_, or _Salman Rushdie_, speaking out against cancel culture and the resignation of _Bari Weiss_ from **The New York Times**, because of workplace harassment for her centrist opinion column. The politicization of the murder of _George Floyd_, the riots and autonomous zones that killed more Blacks in a weekend than the whole police killed unarmed Blacks in a year, made me listen to _Thomas Sowell_, an American economist and social theorist.

Sowell on culture as main driver for social problems as the result of a study that showed that black kids of in Germany stationed soldiers had no disadvantages to other kids:

---

<Blockquote author="Thomas Sowell" source="Intellectuals and Race">

Professor Flynn concluded that the reason ‚Ä¶ was that the offspring of black soldiers in Germany <q>grew up in a nation with no black subculture.</q>

</Blockquote>

<Blockquote author="Thomas Sowell" source="A Legacy of Liberalism">

If we wanted to be serious about evidence, we might compare where blacks stood a hundred years after the end of slavery with where they stood after 30 years of liberal welfare state. In other words, we could compare hard evidence on ‚Äòthe legacy of slavery‚Äô with hard evidence on the legacy of liberals.

</Blockquote>

<Blockquote author="Thomas Sowell" source="A Legacy of Liberalism">

Despite the grand myth that black economic progress began or accelerated with the passage of the Civil Rights laws and ‚ÄòWar on Poverty‚Äô programs of the 1960s ‚Ä¶ the fact is that the poverty rate among blacks fell from 87 percent in 1940 to 47 percent by 1960 ‚Ä¶ Over the next 20 years, the poverty rate among blacks fell another 18 percentage points ‚Ä¶ This was the continuation of a previous economic trend, but at a slower rate of progress, it was not some economic grand deliverance.

</Blockquote>

<Blockquote author="Thomas Sowell" source="A Legacy of Liberalism">

[M]ost black children were being raised in two-parent families in 1960. But thirty years after the liberal welfare state ‚Ä¶ the great majority of black children [were] being raised by ‚Äì single parent[s].

</Blockquote>

<Blockquote author="Thomas Sowell" source="Discrimination and Disparities">

[T]he poverty rate among black married couples has been less than 10 percent every year since 1994 ‚Ä¶ As far back as 1969, young black males whose homes included newspapers, magazines, and library cards ‚Ä¶ had similar incomes to ‚Ä¶ [those of] their white counterparts ‚Ä¶ [A]cademic outcomes show a pattern of disparities similar to the pattern of disparities in the amount of time devoted to schoolwork ‚Ä¶ Apparently ‚Ä¶ lifestyle choices have major consequences.

</Blockquote>

<Blockquote author="Thomas Sowell" source="The Thomas Sowell Reader, P. 210">

This is the age of complaining classes, whether they are lawyers, community activists, radical feminists, race hustlers, or other squeaking wheels looking for oil ‚Ä¶ No society ever thrived because it had a large and growing class of parasites living off those who produce.

_Thomas Sowell_ is a huge opponent of _Affirmative Action_ as his numbers prove that it harms the Black community since more than 50 years. Interesting is what two persons of the Supreme Court had to say to the topic:

<Blockquote author="Clarence Thomas, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States">

I believe blacks can achieve in every avenue of American life without the meddling of university administrators ‚Ä¶ The Court ‚Ä¶ holds that racial discrimination in admissions should be given another 25 years ‚Ä¶ While I agree that in 25 years ‚Ä¶ [these] practices will be illegal, they are ‚Ä¶ illegal now.

</Blockquote>

---

<Blockquote author="Antonin Scalia, Supreme Court Justice">

I think it unnecessary to describe the Restorative Justice Handicapping System any further. I trust you find it thoroughly offensive, as I do. It, and the racist concept of restorative justice of which it is merely the concrete expression, is fundamentally contrary to the principles that govern, and should govern, our society. _I owe no man anything, nor he me, because of the blood that flows in our veins_.

_Naval Ravikant_ brought up interesting arguments against Socialism and the problem the universities have in the USA with the fields of _The Humanities_:

<Blockquote author="Naval Ravikant" source="Joe Rogan Experience #1309" sourceUrl="https://youtu.be/3qHkcs3kG44">

I think, really, Socialism comes from the heart, right? We all wanna be Socialists. Capitalism comes from the head because there are always cheaters in any system, and there is an incentive in any system. So, when you‚Äôre young, if you‚Äôre not Socialist, you have no heart, when you‚Äôre older and you‚Äôre not a capitalist you have no head, right? You haven‚Äôt thought it through. So, I understand where it comes from. I always like Nassim Taleb's take on this: <q>With my family, I‚Äôm a communist. With my close friends, I‚Äôm a socialist. At the state level of politics, I‚Äôm a Democrat. At higher levels, I‚Äôm a Republican, and at the federal levels, I‚Äôm a Libertarian.</q> So, basically, the larger the group of people you have massed together, who have different interests, the less trust there is, the more cheating there is, the better the incentives have to be aligned, the better the system has to work, the more you are towards capitalism. The smaller the group you‚Äôre in, you‚Äôre in a Kibbutz, you are in a commune, you‚Äôre in your house, you‚Äôre in your tribe, by all means, be a Socialist. With my aunts, with my brother, with my cousins, with my uncles, my mom, my family ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a Socialist. That‚Äôs the right way to live a loving, happy, integrated life. But when you‚Äôre dealing with strangers, you wanna be a real Socialist? Great, open all your doors and windows tomorrow. Please, everybody, come and take what you want. See how that works out.

<Blockquote author="Naval Ravikant" source="Joe Rogan Experience #1309" sourceUrl="https://youtu.be/3qHkcs3kG44">

The universities got their credibility from the hard sciences. So, they got this from physics and math, computer science, and chemistry. Because these deliver real things: Manhattan Project, microprocessor, the space vehicle, and so on, the electric car. So, they gained this mental authority and legitimacy from the hard sciences. So, then come the social sciences kinda sneak in. You get economics, and micro-economics is a real discipline, real science, real math behind it. Logic, reason. And you got macro-economics which gets politicized a little bit more voodoo, and then you get social studies, and then you get gender studies ‚Ä¶ So, what happened is, because we took scientists to be the high priests of our new world, science itself got corrupted. And the social sciences, and you can tell they are fake sciences because they have the word science tacked on the end, have come in and highjacked the universities and become the new think tanks. Essentially, what you see going on today at the universities is a war between social sciences and physical sciences. And the crossover is biology. We can see the whole _gender is a construct_ movement is attacking biology, evolution biology. Just like in the social sphere with the comedians. You can see the struggle going on at the universities. I would say physical sciences are essentially losing that war. ‚Ä¶ Physical sciences have the reality on their side ‚Ä¶ At the end of the day, your aircraft has to fly, your microprocessor has to compute. So there is only so far they can take it. But I see for example in biology this difficult thing where they have to say things that they know are not true, to keep their job. ‚Ä¶ Biology will suffer the most. Synthetic biology, for example, a lot of this will end up in China, because you won‚Äôt be able to map facts and reality and actions together.

To suppress free speech is a double wrong. It violates the rights of the hearer as well as those of the speaker.

<Blockquote author="Stewart Slater" source="Intersectionality: A Cheaper Form of Virtue" sourceUrl="https://areomagazine.com/2020/07/21/intersectionality-a-cheaper-form-of-virtue/">

There is no financial cost to the individual in intersectionality as commonly practiced. One can feel good by tweeting about historical slavery on a smartphone whose battery contains Cadmium mined by some of the world‚Äôs forty million current slaves, but it is not required either that one sacrifice one‚Äôs technology in solidarity with them, or seek to change their status, as previous generations of Christians did. Ironically, given the Marxist background of many of its adherents, intersectionality is that most capitalist of phenomena: a low-cost provider of moral self-worth.

  <q>The best thing for being sad</q>, replied Merlin, beginning to puff and

    is to learn something. That‚Äôs the only thing that never fails. You may grow
    old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake at night listening to
    the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only love, you may see the
    world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your honor trampled in
    the sewers of baser minds. There is only one thing for it then ‚Äì to learn.
    Learn why the world wags and what wags it. That is the only thing which the
    mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or
    distrust, and never dream of regretting. Learning is the only thing for you.
    Look what a lot of things there are to learn.

A sense of history is an antidote to self-pity and self-importance, of which there is much too much in our time. To a large degree, history is a lesson in proportions.
