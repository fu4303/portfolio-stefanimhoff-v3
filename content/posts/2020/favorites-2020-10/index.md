<Blockquote source="Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, 2001">

The untested truths spun by different interests continue to churn and accumulate ‚Ä¶ No one is invalidated, but nobody is right. Not even natural selection can take place here. The world is being engulfed in ‚Äòtruth.‚Äô And this is the way the world ends. Not with a bang, but a whimper.

## Stuff & Things

- [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/) ‚Äì I switched from _Spotify_ to _Apple Music_ this month. Spotify censored and de-platformed a small German podcast I‚Äôm listening to out of ideological reasons (they dared to interview an author who wrote a book about gender-transition in children). As Apple Music has 10 Million more songs, lyrics, a nicer app, and the same price, the decision to switch was not hard for me. But the migration of my playlists was stressful because I needed to speed up, as Spotify closed the APIs this month. I got out before the lock-in.
- [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/) ‚Äì My new default Podcast app. I ask myself why I never considered using it before. It syncs across my devices, looks nice, and doesn‚Äôt censor content.

- [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) ‚Äì A fantastic website with scientific data and over 3000 charts on hundreds of topics.
- [Drafts](https://apps.apple.com/app/drafts/id1236254471) ‚Äì A nice app I started using for quickly adding text on the go (via Apple Watch or iPhone) and later convert it to a permanent note in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
- [New Discourses](https://newdiscourses.com/) ‚Äì Pursuing the light of objective truth in subjective darkness. I discovered this fantastic website, founded by _James Lindsay_.

## Quotes

The game _Metal Gear Solid 2_ predicted nearly 20 years ago quite accurately the world we live in. A world where no truth exists, just _My Truth_ and _Your Truth_ instead of **The Truth**.

I‚Äôve seen many wrong statements retweeted by the people I follow on social media that the only explanations are filter bubbles, groupthink, and the laziness of finding out the truth.

<Blockquote source="Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, 2001">

The untested truths spun by different interests continue to churn and accumulate ‚Ä¶ No one is invalidated, but nobody is right. Not even natural selection can take place here. The world is being engulfed in ‚Äòtruth.‚Äô And this is the way the world ends. Not with a bang, but a whimper.

_Elon Musk_ summarised on _Joe Rogan‚Äôs_ podcast, that governments, thinking they can just lock down the economy for unlimited time and solve the resulting crisis by printing money, won‚Äôt work:

<Blockquote author="Elon Musk" source="Joe Rogan Experience 1470 ‚Äì Elon Musk" sourceUrl="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcYjXbSJBN8">

So, this notion that you can just sort of send out checks to everybody and things will be fine is not true. Obviously. There are some people that have this absurd view that the economy is like some magic horn of plenty. Like it just makes stuff. There is just a magic horn of plenty and the goods and services, they just come from this magic horn of plenty, and then if somebody has more stuff it‚Äôs because they took more from this magic horn of plenty. **Now let me just break it to you, the fools out there. If you don‚Äôt make stuff, there‚Äôs no stuff.** [‚Ä¶] You can‚Äôt just legislate money and solve these things. If you don‚Äôt make stuff, there is no stuff. Obviously.

_Thomas Sowell_ summarises what was already predicted in early 2020 by a few people: That the upcoming election will be used to start race riots for political reasons.

<Blockquote author="Thomas Sowell">

Racism is not dead. But it is on life-support, kept alive mainly the people who use it for an excuse or to keep minority communities fearful or resentful enough to torn out as a voting block on election day.

_Jason Fried_ on the _Illusion of Agreement_. Be precise in your communication and don‚Äôt assume two sides have the same understanding of an issue.

<Blockquote author="Jason Fried" source="Signal v. Noise" sourceUrl="https://m.signalvnoise.com/dont-take-their-word-for-it/">

Next time you‚Äôre discussing something with someone ‚Äî inside or outside your organization ‚Äî and you find the outcome contingent upon a relative term or phrase, be sure to clarify it. If they say expedited, you say <q>we need it tomorrow morning, October 3</q>. Expedited is relative, and overnight can be too depending on where someone‚Äôs shipping something from, what time zone they‚Äôre in, etc. Get concrete, get it in writing, and get complete clarity. Slam the door shut on interpretation, and open the door to assuredness.

Retired Navy Admiral and former Navy SEAL _William McRaven_ in one of my favorite commencement speeches about the importance of _little things_.

<Blockquote author="William McRaven" source="If You Want to Change the World, Start Off by Making Your Bed" sourceUrl="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sK3wJAxGfs">

If you wanna change the world, start off by making your bed. If you make your bed every morning, you‚Äôll have accomplished the first task of the day. It will give you a small sense of pride and encourage you to do another task, and another, and another. And by the end of the day, that one task completed, will have turned into many tasks completed. Making your bed will also reinforce the fact, that the little things in life matter. If you can‚Äôt do the little things right, you‚Äôll never be able to do the big things right.

_Colin Wright_ about the sad truth that ideology prevents scientific progress in a lot of scientific areas.

<Blockquote author="Colin Wright" source="The New Evolution Deniers" sourceUrl="https://quillette.com/2018/11/30/the-new-evolution-deniers/">

But it seems clear to me that academia now is not as it was advertised a decade ago when I started down this path. It is no longer a refuge for outspoken, free-thinking intellectuals. Instead, it seems one must now choose between living a zipper-lipped life as an academic scientist or living a life as a fulfilled intellectual. Currently, one cannot do both.

_Thomas Sowell_ about the simple truth that a society can‚Äôt survive if the beliefs of people diverge too far from the truth.

<Blockquote author="Thomas Sowell" source="Quest for Cosmic Justice">

There is only so much divergence between prevailing theories and intractable reality that a society can survive. Yet theories of equality are unlikely to be re-examined‚Äîor examined the first time‚Äîwhen they provide a foundation for the heady feeling of being morally superior to a benighted ‚Äòsociety.‚Äô

_Arlie Hochschild_ suggested an idea I read in similar kind last month in [John Glubb and Avoiding the Fate of Empires](https://quillette.com/2020/09/30/pasha-glubb-and-avoiding-the-fate-of-empires/) by _Leo Nicoletto_: That obligatory civil service could be a solution to political division and help the unity of a country. It would bring people in contact with different people in other regions of a country, and teach respect.

<Blockquote author="Arlie Hochschild" source="Arlie Hochschild ‚Äì The Deep Stories of Our Time" sourceUrl="https://onbeing.org/programs/arlie-hochschild-the-deep-stories-of-our-time/">

It‚Äôs not only a contempt that really bothers me now whenever I hear it or see it, and that is buried to some degree, but there‚Äôs a kind of reluctance to reach out. It‚Äôs as if, on the left, there‚Äôs a lot of good political will, but it‚Äôs gotten curled up onto itself and become a kind of a self-monitoring program, <q>Oh, you said this wrong or that wrong,</q> instead of reaching out to build coalitions ‚Äî because we‚Äôre a big country. Not everyone‚Äôs like us; not everyone‚Äôs like them. What we need are sturdy coalitions. And I think labor unions ‚Äî when the labor movement was much larger, there was a way that people of different colors and classes got together. When you had a compulsory draft, people of different colors and classes got together in a natural way. [‚Ä¶] Public schools have done this. But we‚Äôre down on those crossover, connective institutions. I think we need to build another one. I would like to see a civil service, one year required of everyone. [‚Ä¶] Yeah, of everyone, and you go to a different region and get to know people ‚Äî first of all, get to know how to treat people respectfully and listen actively and be immediate. Everybody should learn those skills. And then go across to see if we can rebuild that connective tissue. [‚Ä¶] I‚Äôm sure people have said to you, and I get into this conversation myself, this critique that there are all kinds of groups of people, including people of color, who have long felt like strangers in their own land in this country.

Reading without processing the ideas is fruitless to _Arthur Schopenhauer_, as reading already takes over a huge amount of the work which is thinking.

<Blockquote author="Arthur Schopenhauer" source="Essays and Aphorisms">

When we read, another person thinks for us: we merely repeat his mental process. [‚Ä¶] This is the case with many learned persons: they have read themselves stupid.
