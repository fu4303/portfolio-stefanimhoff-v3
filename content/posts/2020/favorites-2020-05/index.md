## Videos

- **Joe Rogan** did a [second interview with Elon Musk](https://youtu.be/RcYjXbSJBN8) which was very interesting to watch. Also, he announced a 100 Million Dollar USD deal with Spotify. His show will move to Spotify on September 1st, being exclusively available later this year (still as a free Podcast).
- One of my favorite channels, **What I‚Äôve Learned**, created the video [Why are you Uncertain, Unfocused, and Anxious? What should we do about it?](https://youtu.be/GaJmw54BMcw). It‚Äôs of unbelievable high quality, scientifically researched as usual, with a lot of self-shot content, and also makes uses the new YouTube section feature, to name sections of the video.
- I finished one of the best lectures on Personality by **Jordan B Peterson**: [2017 Personality and Its Transformations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL22J3VaeABQApSdW8X71Ihe34eKN6XhCi), filmed at the University of Toronto. The ~30 hours of lectures are extremely interesting. The last nine lectures dedicate the topic of the Big 5 personality traits and their implications for life.

The history of forbidden coins in [Why This Coin is Illegal to Own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YegtWw4WRLY). [The \$22 Million Most Expensive Party Ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxQ19dzi4YQ) is the story of the party which destroyed (probably) the empire of the last Iranian Shah. And [The Island That Keeps Appearing and Disappearing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFeESzANUXE) explains the story behind a Mediterranean island that appears and disappears.

- **Thomas Frank** shows [Roam Research](https://youtu.be/vxOffM_tVHI), a new note-taking tool on the block. It looks promising, but as I explained in my last article, [Zettelkasten Note-Taking Method With DEVONthink](https://www.stefanimhoff.de/zettelkasten-note-taking-devonthink/), it‚Äôs not for me. He also made a video about [3 habits for better work-life balance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctdUGVmEvfo) and explains [how he takes notes from books](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATDCsY-VJPA) which had good tips I‚Äôll take over.

- The channel **The Beauty Of** created another beautiful collage of the film [The Handmaiden (Ah-ga-ssi)](https://youtu.be/qeK8KoAA31Y). Now I need to see the movie. It‚Äôs not the first time I tried a film or game after watching one of these beautiful pieces of art.
- **The Film Theorists** [solved finally the mystery of the _But Crack Bandit_](https://youtu.be/5tA-aqhz_Ig) in the TV show _Community_. In another video they [explained the dilemma of the writers of Rick and Morty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVq_u2r2tow) and how they created an episode about it. Finally, they explore in [Hey Fallon, You‚Äôre Doing it Wrong!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Omnex5tyfk) how good of a job the late show hosts are doing during the pandemic, how good their performance as YouTubers is and what this might mean for the future.

- This was a good month for everybody interested in history. **Voices of the Past** released two interesting videos: Reading of the Florentine Codex showing [the perspective on the conquest of Mexico by an Aztec](https://youtu.be/FAp30mf1pYY). It was fascinating listening to the story of the conquest from another perspective, including the story of [La Noche Triste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Noche_Triste). In another video, they [read a letter from Will Adams, the Englishman who became a Samurai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nw6jiX2p7k), describing his life in the service of the shogun. His story inspired the novel [Sh≈çgun](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/402093.Sh_gun) by James Clavell.

I found the incredible good interpretation of the song [Apotheosis from Journey](https://youtu.be/XpT-92HS11I) ü§©, played by **Tina Guo** and the Beethoven Academy Orchestra. This is the best performance I‚Äôve ever seen of this song! There were a lot more known songs from games played at this concert.
- **Tina Guo**, an unbelievable talented Chinese-American cellist, has a lot of fantastic performances on her [own channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRcSl2KAMdMEFoKZhHpwH8g). I liked, in particular, her performance of another beautiful song: [Oogway Ascends](https://youtu.be/j_6LC0HFims), a song from Kung Fu Panda and also [her ‚Äúpractice‚Äù of a cover of Lindsey Stirling‚Äôs Crystallize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWEmXMYBP6c).

## TV Shows

- [Beastars](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/90937-beastars) <Flag label="1" /> <NetflixFlag id="81054847" /> ‚Äì This is a really good Japanese animation TV show about a world where herbivores and carnivores coexist with each other. The main characters are a wolf and a rabbit.
- [Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem, and Madness](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/100698-tiger-king-murder-mayhem-and-madness) <Flag label="1" /> <NetflixFlag id="81115994" /> ‚Äì After this show was recommended by multiple people on multiple occasions I started watching it. And it‚Äôs that good. Crazy, bizarre, but good.
- [Community](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/18347-community), <Flag label="4" /> <Flag label="5" /> <Flag label="6" /> <NetflixFlag id="70155589" /> ‚Äì I finished watching this show a second time and it was not one bit less funny than the first time. I think it might be the funniest TV show ever produced.
- [The Hollow](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/79948-the-hollow) <Flag label="2" /> <NetflixFlag id="80147919" /> ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt think this show would have a second season. Not because it‚Äôs not good‚Äîquite the opposite‚Äîbut the story looked like a concluded story arc. But the managed to deliver another fantastic season.
- [Scissor Seven](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/79141) <Flag label="2" /> <NetflixFlag id="81156880" /> ‚Äì This extremely funny, animated, Chinese TV show about a quite unsuccessful assassin and barber with memory loss is one of my highlights of this year. The animation style is fabulous. It changes during an episode all the time. Sometimes characters look cute, then ugly, or powerful, while always keeping the characteristics of a character. Some people probably don‚Äôt even notice the change of style.
- [Final Space](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/74387-final-space) <Flag label="2" /> <NetflixFlag id="80174479" /> ‚Äì Don‚Äôt be fooled by the cute animation style. This space saga is dark. You can get scared of the space watching it.
- [After Life](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/79410-after-life) <Flag label="2" /> <NetflixFlag id="80998491" /> ‚Äì **Ricky Gervais** is really a master combining comedy and tragedy in this TV show filled with whimsical characters.
- [Abstract: The Art of Design](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/70177-abstract-the-art-of-design) <Flag label="2" /> <NetflixFlag id="80057883" /> ‚Äì I finally finished this fantastic TV show. I tried to not do it because now I probably have to wait another two years for the next season. At least the last episode ended strong with **Jonathan Hoefler**. It‚Äôs the best documentaries about Designers I‚Äôve ever seen.
- [Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/83519-patriot-act-with-hasan-minhaj) <Flag label="6" /> <NetflixFlag id="80239931" />
- [La Casa de Papel](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/71446-la-casa-de-papel) <Flag label="2" /> <NetflixFlag id="80192098" /> ‚Äì Damn, I seldom had some much fun watching a money heist TV show. And it‚Äôs also good to learn some Spanish.
- [Suits](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/37680-suits) <Flag label="7" /> <NetflixFlag id="70195800" /> ‚Äì It‚Äôs always entertaining to watch this TV show, even though I usually don‚Äôt understand the legal stunts the characters perform. üò¨ Sad they had to remove two characters from the show because of Meghan Markle marrying into the Royals.

## Movies

- [Extraction](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/545609-extraction) <NetflixFlag id="80230399" /> ‚Äì Don‚Äôt expect too much story, but it‚Äôs a quite nice Action and was fun to watch.
- [Rams](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/510243-rams) ‚Äì A nice documentary by **Gary Hustwit** about the famous industrial designer Dieter Rams. Hustwit made the movie this month a few days for free.

## Music & Podcasts

- [Radio Headspace](https://open.spotify.com/show/5ulnZFwoLkEv566YCZwTvY?si=Xy0PjhajSPy117ZLPcAbGA) ‚Äì A new short, daily podcast about meditation moderated by **Andy Puddicombe**.
- [indubio](https://open.spotify.com/show/69FTLjcQWoXqhtg1hoy12V?si=GeEYg5esSJGmZ7c0TEti5w) üá©üá™ ‚Äì I found this new German political podcast by **Die Achse des Guten** (_The Axis of Good_) which has really good and broad discussions about current politics. It encourages your thinking by touching controversial topics. One episode talked about the topic of obedience of people to orders of the government regarding COVID-19, [Die Obrigkeit droht uns](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4HB2rSFwjQaB3PCQ60aidL?si=1kqXaSx6SqWzVP1DbMAmlQ). Another one had an interesting interview with a lawyer who just won a lawsuit against a censorship agency of Facebook labeling opinions as ‚Äúfalse‚Äù in [Zensoren haben verloren](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5Xsf0RkYktqPp7kqvpLEUG?si=zhYpAQGdS5G7ojCJvOEkXg).
- [Fest &amp; Flauschig](https://open.spotify.com/show/1OLcQdw2PFDPG1jo3s0wbp?si=wj1D55xySgi8AySsc-o_5g) üá©üá™ ‚Äì I hadn‚Äôt listened to this Podcast by **Olli Schulz** and **Jan B√∂hmermann** for a few years and listened to the Pentecost special [Schweineschwarten im Supermarkt](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5pE22QgHkshUqxdV9E0bAa?si=VjbZbeagS1iEYtQTGP9GjA). It‚Äôs so funny that I‚Äôll probably start to listen regularly to this Podcast.

## Articles

- I read quite a lot of articles about the **Zettelkasten** method as a note-taking system. The website of the [Zettelkasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) has a nice overview of a lot of articles. I particularly liked two articles: [Zettelkasten ‚Äî How One German Scholar Was So Freakishly Productive](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125) by **David B.

Some really true words in this Tweet by **David Perell**. Some service in the cloud is just other peoples computers. If you want to own your publication and creative work, have your own website, and use open technologies. This tweet made me thinking about starting a monthly newsletter:

Own your distribution. If you write online, focus on these two platforms:

1. Email.
2. Websites.

Remember AOL? Remember MySpace? Remember Yahoo? Companies come and go but your email list and personal website will still be valuable in 10 years. Invest in the long-term.

The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of our identity.

Time magnifies the margin between success &amp; failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time you ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.

Dieter Rams about the danger to lose control over the digital world:

<Blockquote lang="de" author="Dieter Rams" source="Rams" sourceUrl="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/510243-rams">

Wir m√ºssen achtgeben, jetzt, dass wir die digitale Welt beherrschen und nicht von ihr beherrscht werden.

</Blockquote>

<Blockquote author="Dieter Rams" source="Rams" sourceUrl="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/510243-rams">

We have to be careful now, that we rule over the digital world, and are not ruled by it.

**Jordan B Peterson** explains why Zebras have stripes: Not to camouflage against the environment but the herd. Lions are not able to target individual Zebras when they stay with the herd. He uses this as an analogy to explain similar human behavior:

<Blockquote author="Jordan B Peterson" source="2017 Personality 21: Biology & Traits: Performance Prediction, 33:25" sourceUrl="https://youtu.be/Q7GKmznaqsQ">

The rule for human beings is: Keep your damn stripes on, so the lions don‚Äôt get you. [‚Ä¶] If you want to remember one thing from my class about human motivation that‚Äôs a good thing to learn: People camouflage themselves against the herd. And they like to be in the middle of the herd [‚Ä¶] That‚Äôs what people are trying to do all the time.

**Jordan B Peterson** about the fact that persistency is more important than success for habit change:

<Blockquote author="Jordan B Peterson" source="2017 Personality 22: Conclusion: Psychology and Belief, 3:00" sourceUrl="https://youtu.be/J9j-bVDrGdI">

You come, you have a problem, your life isn‚Äôt what it could be. Fine, let‚Äôs see what it could be like if we changed it. Well, figure out how to change it, that‚Äôs gonna be a negotiated dialogue. [‚Ä¶] I can help you figure it out maybe, we can talk about it, but you are the person who has to decide if the things that you‚Äôre aiming for get you out of bed in the morning. [‚Ä¶] And you have to understand that you gonna be bad at it, but it doesn‚Äôt matter, because bad is fine. **Persistent is what you need to be. If you persist with tiny improvements, you win.**

**Jordan B Peterson** about Totalitarianism and ideology and that a system usually fails on all levels at the same time:

<Blockquote author="Jordan B Peterson" source="2017 Personality 22: Conclusion: Psychology and Belief, 45:00" sourceUrl="https://youtu.be/J9j-bVDrGdI">

That happens if you are an ideologue. You identify really hard with that plan. The problem is, if something comes up to confront it, well how do you act? You can‚Äôt let go of the plan, because you drown. Then you cling to it rigidly. Well, that‚Äôs no good, because then you can‚Äôt learn anything. If that‚Äôs you, you are a totalitarian. You are not gonna learn anything. You are gonna end up in something that is close enough to hell so that you won‚Äôt know the difference. And you might drag anyone along with you. That happened plenty of times, it‚Äôs the whole story of the 20th century. It happened over and over and over, and it happens in peoples states, it happens in their business organizations, it happens in their cities, it happens in their provinces, it happens in their states and it happens in their psyches. All at the same time. You can‚Äôt blame the manifestation of that sort of thing on any of those levels. When a society goes down that way it goes down everywhere at the same time. It‚Äôs not the totalitarians at the top and all the happy people striving to be free at the bottom. Not at all. It‚Äôs Totalitarianism on every single level of the hierarchy.

**Jordan B Peterson** about obstacles as an opportunity:

<Blockquote author="Jordan B Peterson" source="2017 Personality 22: Conclusion: Psychology and Belief, 47:00" sourceUrl="https://youtu.be/J9j-bVDrGdI">

Then you think exactly what are you? You are not the chaos, you are not the plan. Maybe you‚Äôre the thing that confronts the obstacle. And I would say, that‚Äôs the categorical lesson of psychology in so far as it has to do with personal transformation. That‚Äôs what you always teach in psychotherapy. [‚Ä¶] You are the thing, that can confront the obstacle to the plan. [‚Ä¶] The obstacle is not only an obstacle but opportunity itself. Well, then your whole view of the world can change. Well you might think, I got this plan, and something came up to object to it. It‚Äôs possible that that thing that is objecting has something to teach you that will take you to the place where you develop an even better plan. That‚Äôs a nice framework to use. Are you so sure this is a problem? Is that the only way you can look at it? Or is it an opportunity?

He continues that even a hard fate like the death of a loved ones offers an opportunity to be a role model and take over responsibility:

<Blockquote author="Jordan B Peterson" source="2017 Personality 22: Conclusion: Psychology and Belief, 48:07" sourceUrl="https://youtu.be/J9j-bVDrGdI">

You want to be the useful person at a funeral. [‚Ä¶] You want to be the person on who‚Äôs shoulder people cry. [‚Ä¶] It is really something to be the reliable person at a funeral.

**Jordan B Peterson** explains the Oedipal mother from Sigmund Freud‚Äôs theory: A person in co-dependence trying to keep others dependent:

  <p>
    <q>
      I love my child, I love my mother, so much that I couldn‚Äôt survive should
      anything happen to them.
    </q>{" "}
    It‚Äôs like you ‚Ä¶ have some serious thinking to do about that! You really want
    to curse someone with that kind of love? <q>I couldn‚Äôt live without you</q>.
    My god, get away from me! Really, it‚Äôs terrible!

He continues how important it is for a person to let others reach independence. Keeping a person dependent is toxic, oedipal behavior:

<Blockquote author="Jordan B Peterson" source="2017 Personality 22: Conclusion: Psychology and Belief, 49:38" sourceUrl="https://youtu.be/J9j-bVDrGdI">

That‚Äôs the oedipal mother. <q>I forgive you no matter what you do</q>. Really? No matter what I do? You are not my friend. That‚Äôs for sure. Not at all. It‚Äôs a horrible thing to do to someone. [‚Ä¶] That‚Äôs the oedipal mother, that‚Äôs one of Freud‚Äôs major discoveries. [‚Ä¶] The devouring force of love. You want the person to be able to stand on their own and the price you pay for that is that you stand on your own.
