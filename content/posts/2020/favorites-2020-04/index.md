_Jason Fried_ answers in a live-stream the question: <q>How do we help first time work from home employees to ensure we are getting the most out of them?</q> that he doesn’t like this kind of management style, but rather getting the best out of an employee than the most:

<Blockquote author="Jason Fried" source="REMOTE Livestream Q&A with Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson" sourceUrl="https://youtu.be/KPKOVT4vZD4?t=6450">

The best is not the most. The best is the best.

_Jocko Willink_ quoting _Tim Ferris_ (who had clinical depression and wanted to commit suicide) on [The Candace Owens Show: Jocko Willink](https://youtu.be/N4IrIq2O3RQ?t=2578) on what to do when somebody has psychological issues:

<Blockquote author="Tim Ferris">

Get out of your mind, get into your body.

_Nick Law_, the Vice Chairman of R/GA talks about how it’s impossible to come up with an idea if you just do collective work in teams:

<Blockquote author="Nick Law, Vice Chairman, R/GA" source="Workplace" sourceUrl="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/452889-workplace">

We talk a lot about the connections, about the collaboration, and this space is built for it, but we’re also very mindful of these moments we just need to be left the fuck alone and get a clear mind and get laser. And so, there’s sort of this monkish piece and this sort of social piece and how those things work together is really the tension you’re dealing with because no one’s ever come up with a brilliant idea with 30 people in the room. It just doesn’t happen, you can refine an idea with five people in the room. But you’ve got to start with this sort of seed and I’ve never seen that seed appear, out of anything but one brain.

_Jordan B Peterson_ about how different personalities keep the balance in the society:

<Blockquote author="Jordan B Peterson" source="2017 Personality 17: Biology and Traits: Agreeableness" sourceUrl="https://youtu.be/G1eHJ9DdoEA?t=2213">

What happened when the Spaniards came to North America? 95% of the Native Americans died. Why? Because the Spaniards brought illness. Smallpox, measles, chickenpox, all these things that the Native Americans had absolutely no resistance to. There were hardly any diseases at all in North and South America. The Spaniards showed up, within 15-20 years, 19 out of 20 of the Native Americans were dead. You never know what people are bringing with them.

And so what that means is that how should you respond to people who are outside of your circle of familiarity? Well, the answer is: One, they might kill you, in all sorts of ways. Two, they might bring with them things to trade that are of inestimable value. So you’re stuck. It’s like, how the hell are you going to reconcile that problem?

And the answer is, well we reconcile it temperamentally, roughly speaking. So half the people are temperamentally wired up to say, <q>No, no, no! Let’s keep the damn boxes closed. Took a long time to pack everything in there and to get it into order.</q> And the liberals say, <q>Well wait a minute. You don’t know if you’ve got things in the right boxes, to begin with. The things that you’re keeping in there were getting stale and old. And maybe we need some new ideas and new people to rejuvenate the situation.</q> That’s political discussion. And the political discussion has to proceed because there’s no way of solving that problem except by discussing it.
