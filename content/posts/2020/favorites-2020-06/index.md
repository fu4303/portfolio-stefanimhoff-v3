_Jocko Willink_ on the [Joe Rogan Experience #1492 ‚Äì Jocko Willink](https://youtu.be/bL5RzI5LyVc) about the danger of emotional reaction:

<Blockquote author="Jocko Willink" source="Joe Rogan Experience #1492 ‚Äì Jocko Willink" sourceUrl="https://youtu.be/bL5RzI5LyVc">

No one makes good decisions when they are emotional. I spend my adult life trying to train humans to not get emotional in pressure situations. Why? Because it‚Äôs gonna end bad every single time. Every single time. And yet, that‚Äôs where our society is based on right now. It‚Äôs based on these emotional reactions.
