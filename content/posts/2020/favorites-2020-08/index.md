## Things I enjoyed in August 2020

<Blockquote author="Alexander Solzhenitsyn" source="Gulag Archipelago">

The line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either ‚Äì but right through every human heart ‚Äì and through all human hearts. This line shifts. Inside us, it oscillates with the years. And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained.

## Quotes

_Daryl David_ collected over the years a lot of racist items, while he convinced dozens of Ku Klux Clan members to leave the clan:

<Blockquote author="Daryl Davis" source="Accidental Courtesey: Daryl Davis, Race & America" sourceUrl="https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/films/accidental-courtesy/">

People always say to me, Daryl how can you have this stuff? Why don‚Äòt you burn it? As shameful as it is, you don‚Äôt burn our history, regardless, the good, the bad, the ugly. And the Ku Klux Klan is as American as baseball, apple pie, and Chevrolet.
