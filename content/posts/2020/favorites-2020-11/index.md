## Quotes

You are not for free speech if you donâ€™t defend speech that offends you:

<Blockquote author="Noam Chomsky">

If you believe in freedom of speech, you believe in freedom of speech for views you donâ€™t like. Goebbels was in favor of freedom of speech for views he liked. So was Stalin. If youâ€™re in favor of freedom of speech, that means youâ€™re in favor of freedom of speech precisely for views you despise.

</Blockquote>

_John Stuart Mill_ thought that suppressed speech harms in multiple ways:

<Blockquote author="John Stuart Mill" source="On Liberty, rev. ed. (Boston: Ticknor and Fields, 1863) 35â€“36" sourceUrl="">

But the peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is, that it is robbing the human race; posterity as well as the existing generation; those who dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it. If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth: if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.

</Blockquote>

_Heinrich Heine_ knew that the ban, censorship, and destruction of books is the first step to totalitarianism that will kill people in the end:

<Blockquote author="Heinrich Heine">

Where they have burned books, they will end in burning human beings.

</Blockquote>

---

<Blockquote author="Ray Bradbury" source="Fahrenheit 451" sourceUrl="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13079982-fahrenheit-451">

It was a pleasure to burn. It was a special pleasure to see things eaten, to see things blackened and changed. With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python spitting its venomous kerosene upon the world, the blood pounded in his head, and his hands were the hands of some amazing conductor playing all the symphonies of blazing and burning to bring down the tatters and charcoal ruins of history.

_Eric Weinstein_ explains how he compares humans often with terms from computer engineering: Hardware, Software, and Firmware. He is not at all interested in hardware, and very strongly invested in the right firmware of a society.

<Blockquote author="Eric Weinstein" source="The Portal: 41: Douglas Murray â€“ Heroism 2020: Defense of Our Own Civilization, 1:45:25" sourceUrl="https://podcasts.apple.com/de/podcast/the-portal/id1469999563?i=1000495880717">

I tend to talk about software, hardware, and firmware. In essence, hardware is your genetics, the melanin content of the skin which everyone seems so fascinated by at the moment which I donâ€™t believe. Then there is a question about the software. What do you think? What political party do you belong to? But there is also this different issue of the firmware. Like the operating system that rides on the hardware. And Iâ€™m very particular about firmware, and Iâ€™m almost indifferent to hardware. I donâ€™t really care about â€¦ if you told me that there was an advanced European-like civilization in Uganda. Where everyone was black, but me. I would be far happier to live in that society, where the firmware was familiar and the hardware was foreign, then to live in a world in which the firmware got swapped out and everyone shared my exact genetics. I really care about firmware Nationalism, I donâ€™t want hardware Nationalism.

_Eric Weinstein_ explains his ** 5-word law** for the era of social media: <q>Optics create its own substance</q> how the killing of _George Floyd_ serves as an example for confirmation bias that ignores all things that donâ€™t fit the narrative of the case, as similar deaths of white persons or asking questions about how the whole situation happened:

<Blockquote author="Eric Weinstein" source="The Portal: 41: Douglas Murray â€“ Heroism 2020: Defense of Our Own Civilization, 2:22:32" sourceUrl="https://podcasts.apple.com/de/podcast/the-portal/id1469999563?i=1000495880717">

The importance of the George Floyd killing or death, however you see it, is that it was optically perfect as a lynching, provided that you didnâ€™t ask hard questions. To give up an optical lynching out on video simply because there are mitigating and complicated and confounding variables was not possible, because in fact in a weird sense you have a very strong belief that there is prejudices and bigotry that seldom lends itself to simple description. Finally, weâ€™ve got one! And then the idea is when itâ€™s optically perfect and that creates its own substance, that is the minds of many people agree that this officer Derek C. and his knee on his neck caused this death through prejudices and bigotry, then the Tony Timpa killing in Dallas canâ€™t â€¦ that violates the rule. That would complicate the optics.

_Alexis de Tocqueville_ described over 120 years ago how the state tries to create dependent citizens and misuses its power to subdue each person:

<Blockquote author="Alexis de Tocqueville" source="Democracy in America, Vol. II (London: Longmans, Green, and Co., 1899), Chap. 6">

After having thus successively taken each member of the community in its powerful grasp and fashioned him at will, the supreme power then extends its arm over the whole community. It covers the surface of society with a network of small, complicated rules, minute and uniform, through which the most original minds and the most energetic characters cannot penetrate, to rise above the crowd. The will of man is not shattered, but softened, bent, and guided; men seldom forced by it to act, but they are constantly restrained from acting. Such a power does not destroy, but it prevents existence; it does not tyrannize, but it compresses, enervates, extinguishes, and stupefies a people, till each nation is reduced to nothing better than a flock of timid and industrious animals, of which the government is the shepherd.

Let your intellectâ€”not misplaced emotions or tribal ideologiesâ€”inform your positions. To be a truly wise person requires that we recognize those domains best served by our intellect versus those best guided by our emotions.
